# Diablo-III-ladder-analytics

Here will be developed an WinForm app, designed to scoop data from Blizzard Battle Net API for Diablo III.
App uses newtonJson to convert incoming data, parses it through LINQ queries directly into SQLite database, 
hosted in the same folder as the app.

The main purpose of this app are:
- lulz
- proof of concept
- self-edication
- probably some datamining on OP specs/items/builds/whatsoever.

If you are reading this readme - you are free to use this app for whatever reasons you desire.
